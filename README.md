# CSC3020H_Assignment-4
This practical is intended to familiarize me with the 3D side of Unity
I will
be setting up a 3D scene in Unity focused around a player model with a weapon
or item (gun, flashlight?). I can use any model (a basic Cube would do, but
search online for free models (or in the Unity Asset Store)).
I will be tested on my use of Unitys built in functionality for rendering
various 3D aspects in a game. This practical will not test me on the ability to
create advanced shaders but I will need to understand how to use the built
in shaders in Unity.
This practical is designed to prepare me for my final gaming practical. We
recommend that you design the practical in such a way that you can easily reuse
it or pieces of it when it comes time for your final practical since this will save
me some time.
